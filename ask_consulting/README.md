## Javascript Files

Look in dist/ for final uncompressed and minified builds of javascript files:

    dist/ask_consulting_min.js

## Changes to the HTML:

 *Please make the following changes to the HTML:*

   * All speech bubble anchor links should have the class "content-link"
   * Remove the inline javascript, it is now handled through jQuery onClick events

    <a id="insights-link" class="content-link active" href="#">...</a>
    <a id="strategies-link" href="#" class="content-link">...</a>
    ...
