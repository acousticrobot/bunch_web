                            <p>We are experienced in both qualitative and quantitative research techniques.  We meet customers wherever is appropriate- in store, in home or on their phones and computers.</p>
                            <p>We are also available to crystalize insights that clients have already gathered but that are underleveraged.  In many instances we find extensive research that is just sitting on the clientsâ€™ shelves unused.</p>
